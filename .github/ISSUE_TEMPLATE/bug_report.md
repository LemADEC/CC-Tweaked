about: Report some misbehaviour in the mod

<!--
## Before reporting
 - Search for the bug both here and [on the ComputerCraft issues page](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+)
 - If possible, try to reproduce on vanilla ComputerCraft. If it still occurs, [report on the ComputerCraft repo](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/issues/new) instead.

## Useful information to include:
 - Minecraft version
 - CC: Tweaked version
 - Detailed reproduction steps!** Sometimes I can spot a bug pretty easily, but often it's much more obscure. Anything you can give which will help reproduce it means it'll get fixed quicker.
