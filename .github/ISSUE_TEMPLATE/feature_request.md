<!--
## Before reporting
 - Search for the suggestion both here and [on the ComputerCraft issues page](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+). It's possible someone's suggested it before!
 - Unless something is specific to CC:Tweaked, try to [suggest them on the ComputerCraft repo](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/issues/new). There's a lot more people watching it, so it allows the wider community to contribute.
-->

## Useful information to include:
 - Explanation of how the feature/change chould work.
 - Some rationale/use case for a feature. I'd like to keep CC:T as minimal
